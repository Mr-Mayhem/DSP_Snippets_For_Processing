  Derivatives_of_Gaussian_Bell_Curve.pde 
  A Processing sketch for plotting a bell curve and 
  its first 5 derivatives in the same plot.
  
  Created by Douglas Mayhew, November 9, 2016.
  Released into the public domain.

 Core bell curve code originally from
 Daniel Shiffman
 The Nature of Code
 http://www.shiffman.net/

  Notes: Comment "background(0);" in the loop to see the whole series combined together, 
  creating a hyperbola.
  
  Comment the 
  point(x, y);
  lines to hide derivatives so the uncommented ones are less cluttered.
  
  Note that the second derivative of a Gaussian bell curve is often used as an 
  inpulse or "kernel" ingredent to perform image processing edge detection via 
  convolution, in one loop, instead of two seperate loops as with other methods.
  
  It is this angle I am investigating for use in my convolution.pde Processing sketch.
